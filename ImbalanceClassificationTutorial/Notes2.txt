Probability Metrics
Classification Predictive modeling involves predicting a class label for an example

On some problems a specific class label is not required and instead the probability of being part of particular class is given. 
Probability metrics are those designed to quantify the skill of a classifier using predicted probability instead of crisp class labels. 
They provide a single value that can be used to compare the different models based on how well the probabilities match expected probabilities.

In practice the data set will not have target probabilities byt class labels. 

For example a two class problem (binary) will have class labels 0 for negative and 1 for positive. When the class label 0 then probability of the class labels of 0 and 1 will be 1 and 0.
When the class labe is 1 the probability of the class labels 0 and 1 will be 0 and 1.

Example with class=0: P(class=0)=1, P(class=1)=0
Example with class=1: P(class=0)=0, P(class=1)=1

adding a third class
Example with class=0: P(class=0)=1, P(class=1)=0, P(class=2)=0
Example with class=1: P(class=0)=0, P(class=1)=1, P(class=2)=0
Example with class=2: P(class=0)=0, P(class=1)=0, P(class=2)=1

This simplified example means we only need to know the probability of the example belonging to class 1 to represent the probability of the binary classification (Bernoulli distribution)
Example with class=0: P(class=1)=0
Example with class=1: P(class=1)=1

two populare metrics for evaluating predicted probabilities are Log Loss and Brier Score

Log Loss for Imbalanced Classification
Calculates the negative log likelihood for probability predictions made by the binary classification model.

LogLoss = -(P(class=0)*log(P(class=0))+(P(class=1))*log(P(class-1)))
Best possible logLoss is 0 and positive values goe to infinity getting worse as they get higher

If you are just predicting the positive cvlass then you can use 
LogLoss = -((1-y)*log(1-yhat)+y*log(yhat))
AverageLogLoss = 1/N* sum i in N -((1-y)*log(1-yhat)+y*log(yhat))

Brier score calculates the mean squared error between predicted probabilities and expected values
erro score is always between 0 and 1 where a model with perfect skill will have a score of 0

calculated for positive predicted probabilities (yhat) compared to expected (y)

BrierScore = 1/N sum i to N (yhat_i - y_i)^2

it takes the probabilities of the positive class only and returns an average score.
