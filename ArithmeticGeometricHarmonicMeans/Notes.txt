Notes on average, geometric and harmonic means 
Average - the central tendency - single number representing the most common value for a list of numbers

Highest probability from the probability distribution that describes all positive values a variable may have.

Mean, mode and median are all averages. 

Mean is different to the median and mode as it is calculated 
There are three types of mean calculation
Arithmetic mean
Geometric mean
Harmonic mean

Arithmetic mean - Sum of the values divided by total number of values (N)
ArithmeticMean = (x1 + x2 + ...+N) / N
A more convenient way to calculate it is
ArithmeticMean = (1/N) * (x1 + x2 + ...xN)

it is appropriate when all values in the data have the same units of measure and values can be positive, negative or zero

Arithmetic mean can be easily distorted if there are a few outliers or for data with no standatd distribution (eg multiple peaks)

it is useful in machine learning when summarizing a variable and when the data has a gaussian or gaussian like distribution


Geometric mean 
Calculated as the N-th root of the product of all values, where N is the number of values

GeometricMean = N-root(x1 *x2*...*xN)

So for 2 values the square root of the product of the 2 numbers is the geometric mean. For 3 the cube roote of the product of the 3 numbers etc.

Appropriate when the data contains values of different units of measure eg height, dollars and miles in the same dataset.
It does not accept negative or zero values. 

One common example of geometric mean in machine learning is the calculation of the G-Mean metric that is a model evaluation metric to calculate the geometric mean of the sensitivity and specificity metrics.

Harmonic Mean 
Calculated as the number of values N divided by the sum of the reciprocal of the values (1 over each value)
HarmonicMean = N/(1/x1 + 1/x2 + ...1/xN)
If there are just two values this can be simplified to
(2*x1*x2)/(x1 +x2)

It is appropriate if the data is comprised of rates.
Rate is ratio between two quantities with different measures (eg speed, acceleration, frequenecy)
Does not take negative or zero values
Common use in machine learning is the F-Measure (F1 or FBeta)


Which mean to use

If the values have the same unit use the Arithmetic mean
If the values have differing units use the Geometric mean
If the values are rates use the harmonic mean

But for negative or 0 values you cannot use geometric or harmonic mean.
